# AQI (Air Quality Index)
AQI is used to calculate the level of pollutants in the air that we breathe, as air or oxygen is an integral part of our lives without which our survival on earth is not possible hence it becomes really important to keep a check on the quality of air that we are breathing ,as too much concentration of pollutants and contaminations in air will lead to various diseases related to respiration hence its the need of hour in today's world.

Working
It works by taking the data set of previous years to calculate the AQI of current and upcoming years. Here we are taking API key from- "https://aqicn.org/api/vn/" Based on this API data will get the results of air qualtiy

Levels of AQI
0-50 -Good
51-100 -Moderate
101-150 -Unhealthy for sensitive group
151-200 -Unhealthy
201-300 -Very Unhealthy
301-500 -Hazardous
Significance of AQI
In areas with continuous air monitoring systems, large volumes of data are collected, which can be difficult for the general public to interpret. AQI bridges this gap by indexing the air quality and providing clear, actionable information on how individuals can protect themselves from air pollution.
AQI is all the more important in developing nations like India where the common man is not quite familiar with the technical terminologies and measuring units (like ppm /ppb / or Âµg/mg3 ).
